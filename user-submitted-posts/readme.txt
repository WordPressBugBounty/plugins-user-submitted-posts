### ✨ Privacy ###

__User Data:__ This plugin enables users to submit post content. It collects data _only_ from users who voluntarily submit content via the USP form. The only involuntary data that is collected is the IP address of the person submitting the form. The plugin provides an option to disable IP collection completely.

__Cookies:__ This plugin uses simple cookies to enable dynamic form functionality. No cookies are used for any other purpose.

__Services:__ This plugin provides an option to enable Google reCaptcha, which is provided by Google as a third-party service. For details on privacy and more, please refer to official documentation for [Google reCaptcha](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/). This plugin also provides an option to enable Cloudflare Turnstile, which is provided by Cloudflare as a third-party service. For details on privacy and more, please refer to official documentation for [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/). No other outside services or locations are accessed/used by this plugin.


### ✨ Developer ###

User Submitted Posts is developed and maintained by [Jeff Starr](https://x.com/perishable), 15-year [WordPress developer](https://plugin-planet.com/) and [book author](https://books.perishablepress.com/).



== Installation ==

### How to install the plugin ###

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Configure your options via the plugin settings
3. Display the form via shortcode or template tag

[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#installing-plugins-1)


### Display the form ###

To display the form on any WP Post, Page, or widget, add the shortcode:

	[user-submitted-posts]

Or, to display the form anywhere in your theme, add the template tag:

	<?php if (function_exists('user_submitted_posts')) user_submitted_posts(); ?>

__Important:__ When copy/pasting the shortcode, __use the plain-text editor__ or block. Using the Visual/RTE Editor may introduce unwanted artifacts when copy/pasting from a web page. Specifically, if you copy the above shortcode and paste it directly into a visual editor or block, the shortcode may be wrapped in code tags. And when the shortcode is wrapped in code tags, the form will display very poorly on the front end.


### Customize the form ###

There are three main ways to customize the form:

* Visit the plugin settings to show/hide fields, configure options, etc.
* Enable the custom form template (check out "Custom Submission Form" below)
* Developers can use [action and filter hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/hooks/)


### Custom Submission Form ###

Out of the box, User Submitted Posts provides a highly configurable submission form. Visit the plugin settings to control which fields are displayed, configure options, and so forth.

There are cases however, where advanced form configuration may be required. In order to allow for this, USP makes it possible to create a custom submission form. Here are the steps:

First, copy these two plugin files:

	/user-submitted-posts/resources/usp.css
	/user-submitted-posts/views/submission-form.php

Then, paste those two files into a directory named `/usp/` in your theme:

	/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/usp.css
	/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/submission-form.php

Lastly, visit the plugin settings and set the "Form style" option to "Custom Form + CSS".

You can now customize the two files as desired. The files will not be overwritten when the plugin is updated. For help with making basic changes to the custom form, check out the [USP FAQs](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#customize-form) at Perishable Press.

Alternately, you can set the option "Form style" to "HTML5 Form + Disable CSS" to use the default USP form along with your own CSS. FYI: here is a list of [USP CSS selectors](https://m0n.co/e). 

Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/). USP Pro provides a form builder within the WP Admin Area, where you can add any fields, labels, text, and so forth.


### Display submitted posts ###

User-submitted posts are handled by WordPress as regular WP Posts. So they are displayed along with your other posts according to your theme design. 


### Display custom fields ###

To display submitted custom fields, visit the plugin settings and configure the "Auto-Display" options.

Also, here is a [Helper Plugin to display Custom Fields](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-custom-field-helper-plugin/). It is designed for use with the Pro version, but also works great with the free version.

For more flexibility, you can use a variety of WP Template Tags (e.g., [get_post_meta()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/)) to display custom fields.


### Display submitted images ###

To display submitted images, visit the plugin settings and configure the "Auto-Display" options.


### Display a Featured Image ###

To display a Featured Image (aka Post Thumbnail) for each submitted post, visit the plugin settings &gt; Image Uploads &gt; Featured Image.


### Shortcodes ###

User Submitted Posts provides a set of useful shortcodes. Check out the "Display the Form" panel in the plugin settings for examples and quick information.

	[user-submitted-posts]                        : displays the form on any Post or Page
	[usp-login-form]                              : displays a login/register/password form
	[usp_display_posts]                           : displays list of all submitted posts
	[usp_gallery]                                 : displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post
	[usp-reset-button url="https://example.com/"] : displays a button to reset the form
	[usp_access cap="read" deny=""][/usp_access]  : limits access to specific user capability
	[usp_visitor deny=""][/usp_visitor]           : limits access to visitors (not logged in) only
	[usp_member deny=""][/usp_member]             : limits access to logged-in users


Here is more information about these shortcodes:

__`[user-submitted-posts]`__

Displays the post-submit form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.


__`[usp-login-form]`__

Displays the login/register/password form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.

To add Google reCaptcha to the form, you can use a free reCaptcha plugin, for example:

* [reCaptcha by BestWebSoft](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-captcha/)
* [Advanced Google reCAPTCHA](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-google-recaptcha/)


__`[usp_display_posts]`__

Displays a list of all submitted posts. This shortcode accepts two optional attributes, "userid" and "numposts". Examples:

	[usp_display_posts]                           : default displays all submitted posts by all authors
	[usp_display_posts userid="current"]          : displays all submitted posts by current logged-in user
	[usp_display_posts userid="1"]                : displays all submitted posts by registered user with ID = 1
	[usp_display_posts userid="Pat Smith"]        : displays all submitted posts by author name "Pat Smith"
	[usp_display_posts userid="all"]              : displays all submitted posts by all users/authors
	[usp_display_posts userid="all" numposts="5"] : limit to 5 posts from all users
	[usp_display_posts post_type="page"]          : display only submitted pages

The shortcode attributes can be used to customize the post list as desired. Note that the Pro version of USP provides many more options for the [display-posts shortcode](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-list-submitted-posts/).


__`[usp_gallery]`__

__Note:__ This shortcode works only when added to a submitted post. It does nothing when added anywhere else.

Displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post. Customize via the following attributes:

	size    = image size as thumbnail, medium, large or full -> default = thumbnail
	format  = whether to make the image a linked image       -> default = image (can use image or image_link)
	target  = whether to open linked image in new tab        -> default = blank (can use blank or self)
	class   = optional custom class name(s)                  -> default = none
	number  = the number of images to display for each post  -> default = 100
	post_id = an optional post ID to use                     -> default = false (uses global/current post)
	
	Check out the source code inline notes for more info


__`[usp-reset-button]`__

Displays a button to reset the form. Accepts the following attributes:

	class  = classes for the parent element (optional, default: none)
	value  = link text (optional, default: "Reset form")
	url    = the URL where your form is displayed (required, default: none)
	custom = any attributes or custom code for the link element (optional, default: none)

Note that the `url` attribute accepts `%%current%%` for the current URL (useful when the form is displayed in the sidebar).


__`[usp_access]`__

Limits access to specific user capability. Example:

	[usp_access cap="read"]
		Content for users that have "read" access
	[/usp_access]

The `cap` attribute specifies the required capability or capabilities (comma-separated). This shortcode also accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the "Display the Form" panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.


__`[usp_visitor]`__

Limits access to visitors (not logged in) only. Example:

	[usp_visitor]
		Content for for users who are not logged in
	[/usp_visitor]

This shortcode accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the "Display the Form" panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.


__`[usp_member]`__

Limits access to logged-in users. Example:

	[usp_member]
		Content for for users who are logged in
	[/usp_member]

This shortcode accepts an optional `deny` attribute. The `deny` attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use `{tag}` to display `<tag>`. Check out the "Display the Form" panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.

	*/
	
	usp_get_images()

These template tags should work out of the box when included in your theme template file(s). Keep in mind that for some of the tags to work, there must be some existing submitted posts and/or images available. 

The source code for these tags is located in `/library/template-tags.php` and `shortcode-login.php`.


### Content Restriction ###

USP provides three "Access Control" shortcodes to control access and restrict content. Here are some examples to give you an idea of how it works.

Display form and/or content only to users with a specific capability:

	[usp_access cap="read" deny="Message for users without read capability"]
		[user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
	[/usp_access]

Display form and/or any content to logged-in users:

	[usp_member deny="Message for users who are not logged in"]
		[user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
	[/usp_member]

Display form and/or any content to visitors only:

	[usp_visitor deny="Message for users who are logged in"]
		[user-submitted-posts] // Put the USP form or any other content here.
	[/usp_visitor]

You can add and use Access Control shortcodes on any WP Post or Page. Tip: you can find this information (and more) in the plugin settings &gt; Display the Form &gt; Access Control.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can you add this feature or that feature?**

Please check the [Pro version of USP](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/), which includes many of the most commonly requested features from users. The free version also may include new features in future updates.


**How to set submitted image as the featured image?**

Here are the steps:

1. Visit USP settings &gt; Options panel &gt; Image Uploads &gt; Featured Image
2. Check the box and click "Save Settings" to save your changes

Note that this setting merely assigns the submitted image as the Featured Image; it's up to your theme's single.php file to include `the_post_thumbnail()` to display the Featured Images. If your theme is not so equipped, [check out this tutorial at WP-Mix](https://wp-mix.com/set-attachment-featured-image/).


**How to require login?**

To require login to use the form, visit the plugin settings and enable the option to "Require User Login". That will display the submission form only to logged-in users.

For more fine-grained control, head on over to the [Installation tab](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/#installation) and scroll down to the section on "Content Restriction".


**How do I change the appearance of the submission form?**

The easiest way to customize the form is via the plugin settings. There you can do things like show/hide specific fields, control the number and size of submitted images, customize the Challenge Question, and so forth.

Also in the plugin settings, you can choose one of the following form configurations:

* HTML5 Form + Default CSS (Recommended)
* HTML5 Form + Disable CSS (Provide your own styles)
* Custom Form + Custom CSS (Provide your own form template & styles)

To learn how to set up the Custom Form + Custom CSS, visit "Custom Submission Form" under the [Installation tab](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/#installation).

For advanced customization, developers can use [USP action and filter hooks](https://perishablepress.com/action-filter-hooks-user-submitted-posts/).

To go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/). USP Pro provides a form builder within the WP Admin Area, where you can add any fields, labels, text, and so forth.


**Can I include video?**

The free version of USP supports uploads of images only, but some hosted videos may be included in the submitted content by simply including the video URL on its own line. Check out the [Embeds documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/) for more info. Note that [USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) enables users to [upload video and other file types](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-allowed-file-types/#file-formats) supported by WordPress.


**How do I reset the plugin settings?**

To reset plugin settings to factory defaults:

1. Visit "Restore Default Options" in the plugin settings
2. Check the box and save your changes
3. Deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it
4. Plugin settings now are restored to defaults

Restoring default settings does not delete any submitted posts. Even if you completely remove the plugin, the submitted posts will not be deleted. You have to remove them manually, if desired.


**Can you explain the setting "Registered Username"?**

When "Registered Username" is enabled:

* If the user is logged in, their registered username is used as the Post Author
* If the user is logged out, the setting "Assigned Author" is used as the Post Author
	
When "Registered Username" is disabled:

* The setting "Assigned Author" always is used as the Post Author for all users (whether logged in or not)


**How can I translate this plugin?**

Currently the easiest and most flexible method is to [use GlotPress to translate USP](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/user-submitted-posts). That is the recommended translation route going forward, but for the time being you may also translate using a plugin such as [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/). FYI, USP's translation files are located in the `/languages/` directory.


**Why am I not receiving the Email Alerts?**

Normally the plugin sends an Email Alert each time a post is submitted. If that is not happening in your case, you will need to troubleshoot your setup. Here is a guide on [Troubleshooting Email](https://perishablepress.com/email-troubleshooting-guide/) that should help.


**How to disable fancy category/tag select script?**

USP uses the Chosen.js library to enhance the behavior and appearance of the Category and Tag fields. The enhanced fields will be displayed when either/both of the following are true:

* The option "Multiple Categories" is enabled (for Category field)
* The option "Use Existing Tags" is enabled (for Tag field)

If you want to disable the fancy Chosen script for these fields, you can do so by adding the following code snippet to your WordPress site:

`<script>var usp_disable_chosen = true;</script>`

Save changes and done. Also just FYI, here is a guide that explains [how to add custom code to WordPress](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/).


**How to change the language for Google reCaptcha?**

By default, the Google reCaptcha field is displayed in English. To change that to some other language, first locate the two-digit abbreviation for your language [here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/language). Then add the following code to your theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

`function usp_recaptcha_querystring($query) { return 'en'; }
add_filter('usp_recaptcha_querystring', 'usp_recaptcha_querystring');`

Notice where it says `en`, that is the two-character language code you want to replace with your own. Then save changes and done.


**Where can I check out a demo of the USP form?**

There is a simplified [USP Demo](https://perishablepress.com/wp/wp-content/online/pages/user-submitted-posts-demo.html) at Perishable Press. Note the demo form is non-functional, just there to give you a general idea. The actual form provided by the plugin has more features, functionality, etc.


**How to allow blank targets in post content?**

By default, USP removes any `target="_blank"` attributes in submitted post content. This is a recommended security feature. It is possible however to allow blank targets:

`function usp_content_patterns($array) { return array(); }
add_filter('usp_content_patterns', 'usp_content_patterns');`

That code can be added via theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/).


**How to disable all HTML tags in submitted posts?**

Add the code snippet provided [here](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#allowed-tags).


**mod_security is preventing saving changes?**

If mod_security is installed on your server, it may prevent saving changes in the plugin settings. For a further explanation and quick copy/paste code solution, check out [this forum post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-but-cannot-safe-any-changes/#post-18754005). Thanks to [tomlandon](https://wordpress.org/support/users/tomlandon/) for sharing the code solution.


**How do the edit-post and delete-post links work?**

When `%%edit_link%%` is included in the Email Alert settings, a link will be included in the email alert that takes capable users to the Edit Post screen for the submitted post. Likewise when `%%delete_link%%` is included in the Email Alert settings, a link will be included that enables capable users to delete the submitted post. Note that these links work only for users who have sufficient capabilities (e.g., Editor, Admin) AND are logged into WordPress when the link is clicked. For more details and tips, check out the [USP FAQs](https://perishablepress.com/faqs-user-submitted-posts/#delete-post-message) at Perishable Press.

* `user_submit_ip` - the IP address of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_name` - the name of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_url` - the submitted URL
